## Project Details
Made for the "Computação Distribuida" class, in Universidade Lusófona, as its final project.
Made by: Diogo Araújo - 21905661

This project has to be ran in the EclipseIDE where the clients are WebServices.
Involves the creation of InterClass communication between Java "clients" for Hotel room reservation. 


## Project Summary
The objective of this project was the development of a service of room reservations at the "Charm Hotel". This hotel will receive clients and allow the to reserve rooms at the dates they have chosen, as long as the room is available.


This was made in Java using the "IntelliJ" and "Eclipse" platforms. The clients, as they are Webservices, will be ran through "Eclipse" while the server will be ran in a Linux machine (which could be a Virtual Machine such as WSL).


## Architecture
The project architecture is composed by the user interface, which is split between the REST and SOAP client, the "front-end", which are the REST and SOAP webservices, and the "back-end", which is the server.
